        Research and written communication
      </h2>
      <p>
        I have conducted many research projects over the course of my degrees. These projects have included both group and individual work, the collection and analysis of both primary data and secondary data using a range of methodologies, and the critical synthesis of these data with relevant academic literature to present coherent and developed arguments.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Aptitude for learning new skills
      </h2>
      <p>
        I have been required to rapidly learn new skills to complete projects and assignments to schedule. As an example, during my Masters I undertook a project which involved web mapping using Leaflets and other GI technologies. This required learning and implementing several scripts using python, Ajax and jQuery. I successfully achieved this and received a 69% for the assignment.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Analytical skills
      </h2>
      <p>
        Throughout my master’s I have undertaken a wide range of projects which demonstrate my ability to handle complex analytical tasks. These projects have covered a variety of topics such as the multicriteria evaluation of variables to indentify environmentallly disadvatanged areas in Scotland, and the use of self organizing maps to analyze deprivation.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Problem-solving
      </h2>
      <p>
        I undertook several programming modules during my undergraduate AND master’s degree which I greatly enjoyed. Bugs and errors within code are often difficult to notice and so locating and fixing such bugs has required me to develop a determined and methodical approach to problem-solving.

<h2>Geovisualisation for historical research using Leaflet and other web-GIS tools</h2>
<p>
In this project I designed  an interface which would show how web-GIS and its capabilities can be a powerful tool in handling quantitative and qualitative sources in historical research and how this in turn can enrich their discipline.  </p>
<p>A web map was developed for a study area, Islay- rich in history and culture. For this project I developed a database model and implemented it in an Oracle database. The webmap was created as such that changing the data inside the database would change the content of the map. Leaflet, the JavaScript mapping library was used.</p>

           Implementation of an online vampire game using Oracle Spatial
          </h2>
          <p>This fun vampire game was created within 4 weeks for a spatial database course as a group.
            The primary objective of this project was to implement a database in Oracle Spatial to store spatial data, and execute spatial queries and computations. This was achieved by building a game platform. This project contains a number of spatial operations and data structures, allowing us to improve our knowledge of Oracle Spatial, while creating something fun and interactive.
          <p>My responsibility within the group: I designed the website and it's styling as well as the database design.

            Identifying Suitable Sites for Single Medium-Scale Wind Turbines around Kindrogan using GIS and Field Techniques
          </h2>
          <p>
            This was a group project during a fieldtrip to Kindrogan (Scotland) where we identifying suitable sites for medium-scale single wind turbines (100 - 500 kW; Hau, 2013), east of the Kindrogan Field Centre, Blairgowrie .
          </p>
          <p>
           To assess the visual impact of wind turbines in the landscape, I was involved in the creation of photomontages photomontages were created using photographs from the field and the creation of viewsheds. Viewshed analyses were run to establish the visibility of the wind turbine at proposed hub heights (i.e. blade axis) and tip heights (i.e. maximum height) using a 5m DTM at heights 30m and 50m allowing identification of visible and non-visible areas.

            SVG Webmap using the Oracle Database

          <p>
             I was tasked with extracting spatial and non-spatial data from an Oracle database in order to display it on the web using CGI protocol. The map data is retrieved by a python script which accesses the Oracle database and queries it with SQL queries. The python script displays the data on a web server (the webmap is created on-the-fly).
          </p>
          <p>
            A SVG map of archaeological finds and the fields where they were discovered was created. The webmap is interactive (hovering, clicking and display/hide layers) which is programmed in JavaScript.I wrote the main code in Python and used the cx_Oracle module in order to connect to the database. The SQL queries embedded in the Python script were in charge of retrieving the data.

          <p>
            This project explores the difference methods of data visualisation which can be utilised to present a large data set in an online map. Using the Leaflet JavaScript library, it allows for the visualisation of 1,675 recorded cases of criminal damage or arson which occurred in Northumbria in February, 2017.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data can be viewed as raw points, clusters of points, as a choropleth map, or as a heatmap. Accompanying each method of data visualisation is a brief commentary discussing the utility and limitation of each method.

            This project was the final project for the introduction to Java module during my master's degree. It is a basic program to simulate the fallout of particles from a bomb within an abstract environment according to a set of user-defined probabilities.

            Prior to this module I had never coded a program before and, while a basic program overall, this project (for which I received a mark of 98/100) demonstrates my ability to quickly learn complex new skills.

            Projection Peruser &mdash; a Java program to compare how map projections distort the world

          <p>
            This project was the final project for the Advanced Java module during my master's degree. It is a program which allows the user to compare how different map projections distort the world in different ways. It works by re-projecting a shapefile to a number of different coordinate reference systems. It also includes a grid and a set of Tissot's Intricacies to better demonstrate the distortion.
          </p>
          <p>
            The program was coded in Java utilising the GeoTools library. In order to code the program I first had to independently learn GeoTools through its (less than ideal) documentation as GeoTools was not taught in the module.
